Project Title:    Student Record System

Problem Statement:    In my first attempt of creating a Student Record System "Activity 8", I accidentally made it too complex that I struggle in completing Activity 8 due to my hubris.


Program Features:     " 1. Adding Student to the System", " 2. Viewing the student list", " 3. Searching student from the list", " 4. Deleting student from the list"

How to run the program:  Using the program features as the reference, use the first feature to add student to the list, then use the second feature to view the list, and then use the third feature to search for a specific student from the list. Lastly, use the fourth feature to delete a student from the list 

Sample Output:
